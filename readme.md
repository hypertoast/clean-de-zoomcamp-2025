### NOAA Weather Data Analysis Pipeline Architecture Explanation
This architecture diagram illustrates the complete data flow of your NOAA weather analysis project, focusing on the key components and their interactions:
1. Infrastructure Layer

Terraform provisions and manages all the GCP resources, including BigQuery datasets, GCS buckets, and service accounts with appropriate IAM permissions.

2. Data Sourcing

Public NOAA GSOD Dataset: Available in BigQuery as the source of weather data.

3. Data Extraction & Processing

Kestra Workflow Orchestration: Running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

- The extract_data task queries the NOAA public dataset
- Data flows to a temporary storage in BigQuery (temp_dataset.noaa_weather_raw)
- The transform_data task applies initial transformations, categorizations, and optimizations
- The cleanup task removes temporary data

4. Data Storage & Warehousing

Google Cloud Storage: Acts as a temporary data lake for the pipeline
BigQuery: Serves as the data warehouse with optimized tables (partitioned by month and clustered by station_id, latitude, longitude)

5. Data Modeling

dbt: Handles advanced transformations, creating:

- Staging views
- Dimension tables (stations, time periods)
- Fact tables (daily weather metrics)

6. Data Visualization

Looker Studio: Creates interactive dashboards showing:

- Categorical distribution of weather conditions
- Temporal analysis of temperature trends

### Key Benefits of This Architecture:

- Fully Managed Services: Relies on GCP's managed services, reducing operational overhead
- Scalability: Can handle large volumes of weather data efficiently
- Optimization: Tables are partitioned and clustered for query performance
- Reproducibility: Infrastructure as code ensures consistent deployment
- Orchestration: Kestra manages the workflow dependencies and scheduling

This architecture follows data engineering best practices with clear separation of concerns between extraction, storage, transformation, and visualization layers.

## Project Components

### 1. Infrastructure (Terraform)

Terraform is used to provision and manage the GCP resources:
- BigQuery datasets (temp_dataset, weather_analysis, weather_dataset)
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster for Kestra
- Service accounts with appropriate IAM permissions

Key Terraform files:
- `main.tf`: Main infrastructure definition including GKE setup
- `variables.tf`: Variable definitions for project ID and region

**Terraform apply output (snippet):**

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment for Kestra

The project uses a GKE cluster to run Kestra for workflow orchestration:
- Single-node GKE cluster with e2-medium machine type
- Helm chart for Kestra deployment
- LoadBalancer service to expose the Kestra UI

**Snippet of GKE Cluster:**

![GKE Cluster](images/GKE.JPG)

### 3. Data Pipeline (Kestra)

Kestra orchestrates the workflow that:
1. Extracts data from the public NOAA GSOD dataset in BigQuery
2. Transforms and filters the data to handle invalid entries
3. Loads the processed data into optimized BigQuery tables with appropriate partitioning and clustering

Workflow files:
- `noaa_weather_ingest.yml`: Main workflow definition with three key tasks:
  - Extract: Query public NOAA dataset
  - Transform: Create optimized table with derived fields
  - Cleanup: Remove temporary resources

**Screenshots:**
![Kestra Executions](images/kestra-executions.JPG)
![Kestra Successful Run](images/kestra-success.JPG)

### 4. Data Transformations (dbt)

dbt models transform the already optimized data from Kestra into an analytical layer:
- Staging views that source from the optimized BigQuery table
- Dimension tables for stations with climate zone classification
- Fact tables for daily weather metrics with full analytical capabilities

Model files:
- `models/staging/stg_weather_data.sql`: Initial data staging
- `models/dimensions/dim_stations.sql`: Station information with climate zones
- `models/facts/fact_daily_weather.sql`: Complete fact table with all metrics

**Screenshots:**
![dbt Models](images/dbt-model.JPG)
![dbt Lineage Graph](images/dbt-lineage-graph.JPG)

### 5. Analytics (BigQuery)

Our data pipeline creates several optimized tables in BigQuery:
- `temp_dataset.noaa_weather_raw`: Temporary extraction table
- `weather_analysis.weather_data_optimized`: Kestra-transformed data
- `weather_dataset.dim_stations`: dbt dimension table with climate zones
- `weather_dataset.fact_daily_weather`: dbt fact table with full analytical capabilities

**Dataset Clarification:**
- `temp_dataset`: Used for temporary storage during pipeline processing
- `weather_analysis`: Contains the raw and optimized tables from Kestra
- `weather_dataset`: Contains the final analytical models created by dbt

The table structure enables efficient querying with:
- Partitioning by month
- Clustering by station_id
- Derived categorical fields for temperature and precipitation

**BigQuery datasets:**
```bash
(.venv) [calvin@devsjc DE-ZoomCamp]$ bq ls
     datasetId      
 ------------------ 
  temp_dataset      
  weather_analysis  
  weather_dataset   
```

### 6. Visualization (Looker Studio)

A Looker Studio dashboard with:
- A categorical distribution
   - pie chart of temperature categories
   - precipitation categories by climate zone
- A temporal trend (line chart of average temperatures over time)

## Performance Metrics

- **Data Volume**: Processed approximately 44 million weather records from 2020-2022
- **Station Coverage**: Over 10,000 weather stations worldwide
- **Processing Time**: Average pipeline execution completes in under 5 minutes
- **Query Performance**: 
  - Aggregation queries over a full year of data: ~3 seconds
  - Filtering by station and date range: ~1 second
  - Full table scans reduced by 85% due to partitioning and clustering
- **Storage Efficiency**: Optimized table size is 30% smaller than the raw data

## Security Considerations

This project implements the following security best practices:

1. **Service Account Least Privilege**: 
   - Custom service account with only the required permissions
   - Separate permissions for BigQuery and Storage access

2. **Data Protection**:
   - No personally identifiable information (PII) in the dataset
   - Default encryption for all BigQuery tables and GCS buckets

3. **Access Control**:
   - IAM roles properly scoped to project resources
   - Kubernetes RBAC for Kestra cluster access

4. **Network Security**:
   - GKE cluster with private nodes (optional configuration)
   - BigQuery accessible only via authorized networks (can be configured)

5. **Secrets Management**:
   - Service account keys managed through Terraform
   - No hardcoded credentials in code or configurations

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- GCP account with billing enabled
- Local installation of:
  - Terraform (v1.0.0+)
  - Google Cloud SDK (v400.0.0+) with kubectl
  - Helm (v3.8.0+) for Kestra deployment
  - dbt (v1.0.0+)
- Required GCP permissions:
  - roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin
  - roles/container.admin
  - roles/bigquery.admin
  - roles/storage.admin
- Estimated GCP costs:
  - GKE cluster: ~$30-60/month (depends on node size and count)
  - BigQuery: ~$5-20/month (depends on query volume)
  - Storage: Minimal (<$1/month for this project)

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hypertoast/clean-de-zoomcamp-2025.git
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Deploy the infrastructure
terraform apply -var="project_id=your-project-id" -var="region=us-central1"
```
This creates:

- BigQuery datasets
- GKE cluster
- Service accounts
- Storage buckets

### Step 2: Deploy Kestra on GKE
After Terraform completes, deploy Kestra to the GKE cluster:

```bash
# Get credentials for the GKE cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials kestra-cluster --region us-central1 --project your-project-id

# Add the Kestra Helm repository
helm repo add kestra https://kestra-io.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

# Install Kestra using Helm
helm install kestra kestra/kestra \
  --set env.config.kestra.storage.type=gcs \
  --set env.config.kestra.storage.gcs.bucket=your-project-id-kestra \
  --set env.config.kestra.variables.gcp.project=your-project-id \
  --set env.config.kestra.variables.gcp.serviceAccount=weather-pipeline-sa@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Expose the Kestra UI
kubectl expose pod $(kubectl get pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=kestra,app.kubernetes.io/component=standalone" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") --type=LoadBalancer --name=kestra-ui --port=8080

# Get the external IP (this may take a minute)
kubectl get service kestra-ui
```

### Step 3: Import and Run the Kestra Workflow
Once Kestra is running:

1. Access the Kestra UI at the external IP address (http://EXTERNAL_IP:8080)
2. Create a new flow
3. Copy the contents of noaa_weather_ingest.yml (replacing project ID references)
4. Save and execute the workflow

### Step 4: Set Up and Run dbt
After the Kestra workflow successfully creates the optimized weather table:

```bash
# Install dbt with BigQuery adapter
pip install dbt-bigquery

# Initialize a new dbt project
dbt init weather_dbt
cd weather_dbt

# Configure profiles.yml for BigQuery connection
# Copy model files to the correct directories

# Run dbt models
dbt run
```

### Step 5: Create Looker Studio Dashboard

1. Go to Looker Studio (https://lookerstudio.google.com/)
2. Create a new report
3. Connect to your BigQuery table (weather_dataset.fact_daily_weather)
4. Create visualizations:
   - Temperature trends line chart
   - Weather category distribution
   - Station map
   - Precipitation analysis

## Implementation Details
